# RE3R RTX AP Client
Archipelago randomizer client for Resident Evil 3 Remake, designed to work with the RE3R apworld here: https://github.com/dontjoome/RE3R_AP_World

## IMPORTANT / READ FIRST

- Use teleports sparingly, and DO NOT teleport to Downtown areas after fighting Nemesis at the Demolition Site. 
- Do not switch save files, or you may lose items.
- Save often. Save after boss fights. 
- When you complete a randomizer, restart your game before starting another one.

## Missable Locations

- Due to the nature of the game, there are points of no return and as such you can potentially miss items if you progress far enough.
- Setting **Allow Missable Locations** to false will not put progression in those locations, but you will still find useful/junk/traps.
- You can find progression if that setting is set to true, fair warning.
